# Joomla-MassMail

*You can select users and write to them one email*

* Why i should use this?
    * ✅ Free to use
    * ✅ You can select users from one group

__Tested with Joomla 4.1 and php8.0.17__

## Install
- Create a custom HTML, paste the code from index.php in the php section
- Save changes
- You can only access the site if you are the superuser

## Configure
- $group : set this to your groupId where your users are.
- $checkForAdmin : set this to false, then every one can access this module. If it is set to true, then you have to logged in or the system will not load the site
